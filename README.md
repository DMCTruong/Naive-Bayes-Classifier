Fall 2015

Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic classifier that uses Bayes' theorem to classify data based on the similarity of each data. The classifier will assign a set value to each data and follows an algorithm to calculate the similarity of each data. The use of Naive Bayes Classifiers are popular for data mining and machine learning.

# How to use:
1. Two sample tables called, "table.txt" and "table2.txt," are included with the files. The sample tables shows the format of which the program will accept input. In short, the program will accept a textfile containing a table with a space separating each column.

2. Once the user have a table ready, the user must run the program and either enter the filepath to the table or select a sample table to run the program. After that, the program will run the classifier and print out the results to console.
